Reject anything requiring creative interpretation or inference.\n\nQUALITY SCORING (0-100 per dimension)\n\nConsequentiality: how significant are the stakes of the outcome?\n\nActionability: If trusted, how much could the prediction inform or guide meaningful decisions?\n\nForesightedness: how non-obvious, insightful, counter-intuitive, or out-of-consensus is the prediction? What level of intellect or discernment is required to make it?\n\nResolution clarity: how specific is the claimed outcome and timeline?\n\nVerifiability: how easy/difficult is it to verify the prediction\n- scale from deterministic, objective (good) <> fuzzy, but anchored (medium) <> ambiguous or narrative (bad)\n\nConviction level: how confident is the prediction? higher confidence is better. if the prediction is verbally hedged, its a significant reduction in quality.\nbonus if the prediction is explicitly precise about its confidence, by e.g. stating \"p(0.92)\" or \"im very confident about this.\".\n\nTemporal horizon: What is the expected duration until resolution. Shorter is better.\n- super short: <1 month\n- very short: <3 months\n- short: 3-6 months\n- medium: 6-12 months\n- medium long: 1-2 years\n- long: 2-5 years\n- very long: 5-10 years\n- super long: 10+ years\nIf applicable, the temporal horizon score should be contextual and relative to the prediction's domain where natural cycles could be longer, such as geopolitical transitions, medical research or demographics.\nIf there is no clear temporal horizon, that is bad.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown code fences, backticks, or any other formatting.\n\nIf invalid, the rationale should explain why and score null. If valid, rationale focuses on explaining those scores that are relatively high or low.\n\noutput_schema =\n{\n \"valid\": boolean,\n \"scores\": {\n   \"consequentiality\": int,\n   \"actionability\": int,\n   \"foresightedness\": int,\n   \"resolution_clarity\": int,\n   \"verifiability\": int,\n   \"conviction\": int,\n   \"temporal_horizon\": int\n },\n \"brief_rationale\": string (max 300 words)\n}"
